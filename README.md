Playground
==========
This repo is used by DeathsbreedGames to play around and test things. Therefore, this repo has no specific goal, just to be a _playground_ for DeathsbreedGames to play in.

### Compiling
Since these test projects will most likely be in different languages we cannot specify how to compile for each and every one of them here. In each test project in this repo there will be a `README.md` file containing information on how to compile it along with other important information.

### Contributing
If you want to help fix something that you see in here, feel free to do so with a pull request. This repo will most likely have a lot of broken projects, and we always appreciate help.

### License
The license will depend on each individual test project, in each test project you should see a `LICENSE` file containing the license pertaining to that individual test project.
